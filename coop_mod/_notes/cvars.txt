//Configuration-Variables Listing for the HaZardModding
//Co-Op script Mod for Ritual Entertainment's
//Star Trek: Elite Force II


The Co-Op Mod uses configuration variables (Cvars) to
allow for different game modes and personalized
configuration of the Mod. These Cvars can be changed
via the Game/Server Console or directly inside your
server configuration file (*.cfg).

Use seta <variablename> <value> to create a Cvar, if the
game console tells you that the Cvar does not exist.
